# Today's Agenda
I honestly can talk about this for hours, but we're going to put an agenda together because we need to create some direction here.
- **Basics** - Let's define the genre, talk about what it is and what it isn't.
- **Myths** - We're going to dispel some myths about what the public sees vs what the passionate sees.
- **Explore** - We're going to explore some artists, venus, festivals, clubs and instruments that really define the genre. We're going to talk about some of the things that you normally wouldn't associate with it.

# So what is techno?
The **formal definition** taken from Merriam Webster (online of course)

> **electronic dance** music that features a fast beat and **synthesized** sounds usually without vocals or a conventional popular song structure

Techno is used a lot to describe a this type of music, but in all reality, it's actually a sub-type of electronic music.

# So what is techno?
Here's a more in-depth description taken from Wikipedia

> **Much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters**. Techno tracks mainly progress over manipulation of timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets and, unlike forms of EDM that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards, **techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of Western music** and such structures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone. Another distinguishing feature of techno music and techno aesthetic is the **general embracement of creative use of music production technology**.

Key takeaway - not limited to the bounds of conventional music

# A Quick History of Techno
- Originated in Germany in the late 1980s
- Quickly became associated with Detroit (merged european synth-pop to more african music house and electro)
- Detroit & Chicago became hot beds for synthesizer exploration
- [This song (Strings of Life by Derrick May) arguably became the singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQZndywOR4) for the explosion of house music in detroit in 1988.

---

# A Quick History of Techno (continued)
- Acid house started to take shape in Europe at that point which really took roots in warehouses. Seeing as these we're uncontrolled environments, this is where the the party drug / scene started to take place
- During the fall of the Berlin wall, illegal parties exploded; techno is credited with a big part of the re-unification
